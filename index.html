                        <h2>Angel Fall</h2>
                        <p>It is the world's tallest uninterrupted waterfall, with a height of 979 metres (3,212 ft) and a plunge of 807 m (2,648 ft). The waterfall drops over the edge of the Auyán-tepui mountain in the Canaima National Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional Canaima), a UNESCO World Heritage site in the Gran Sabana region of Bolívar State. The height figure, 979 m (3,212 ft), mostly consists of the main plunge but also includes about 400 metres (1,300 ft) of sloped cascade and rapids below the drop and a 30-metre-high (100 ft) plunge downstream of the talus rapids.</p>

                        <p>Los Roques is an archipelago of Venezuela, located in the Caribbean, at 168 Km (100 miles) north of La Guaira, Caracas´ port. For its beauty and ecological importance it was declared national park in 1972. To reach Los Roques, if you don't have your own yacht (or a friend with one), you can take commercial flights from Caracas, Porlamar (Margarita) or Maracaibo. The arrival from the air is spectacular, thanks to the variety of blues than you can see (See aerial views).

                        <p>Margarita is a Caribbean island of Venezuela, located at the Northeast of Caracas, the country's capital, within a 35 minute flight, or a couple of hours by ferry from Puerto La Cruz or Cumana. It is one of the most touristic places in Venezuela. Margarita is well known for the quality of its beaches. Being an island, it is surrounded by beaches, and there is one for every taste. You can find a beach with or without waves, large or small, crowded or not, deep or not, cold or warm, windy or not, just select what you want, and you've got it.

                         <p>Caracas, city, capital of Venezuela, and one of the principal cities of South America. It is Venezuela’s largest urban agglomeration and the country’s primary centre of industry, commerce, education, and culture. Founded in 1567 as Santiago de León de Caracas, the city grew slowly until the 1940s, after which it expanded by monumental proportions, and its influence came to extend to even the remotest parts of the country.

                         <p>Morrocoy National Park, located along the coast about a two-hour drive west of Caracas, is known for its white-sand beaches and coral reefs, which stretch along the mainland and ring the offshore islands and cays. Diving is one of the main activities for those who are looking for more than simply spending a day on the beach. The park is also home to a large number of birds, from osprey and parrots to flamingos and scarlet ibis. Some of the most popular islands are Cayo Sombrero, Cayo Borracho, Cayo Sal, and Cayo Peraza, to name just a few.

                        <p>Canaima National Park covers three million hectares and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is usually associated with Angel Falls and the area around the town of Canaima, but this is actually only a small area of the vastly diverse park. The park also encompasses the high plateau of La Gran Sabana and includes more than 100 tepuis (table top mountains), which rise more than 1,000 meters above the savannahs. A trip through the Gran Sabana and Canaima National Park is a unique experience and does not necessarily even need to be combined with a trip to Angel Falls, particularly during the dry season.

                        <p>The National Pantheon is one of the most important attractions in Caracas. The building was constructed after the 1812 earthquake when the original church on this site was destroyed. Today, it is the country's most sacred shrine and houses the remains of prominent Venezuelans, including those of Simon Bolívar.

                        <p>Medanos de Coro National Park offers surprising sights, with rolling sand dunes typical of a desert scene. The sand dunes, known locally as medanos, roll across the landscape, with twisting and curving lines, and some dunes reach up to 40 meters in height. Dispersed within the hills are a number of lagoons, formed by decades-old flooding. This park is a fun place to wander around, slide down the dunes, take photos, and appreciate the diversity of landscapes that make Venezuela so unique.

                        <h2>Mochima National Park</h2>
                        <p>This park covers a portion of the coast and a chain of offshore islands east of Puerto La Cruz to Cumaná. The main attractions here are the beaches and the diving. The islands can be accessed by boat from Puerto La Cruz, Santa Fé, and Mochima. It is also possible to explore the mainland portion of the park by car or bus, stopping off at small villages and beach-lined bays off highway 9, but this is primarily a place for boating. The area around the park is very quiet and it doesn't see nearly the amount of traffic as Morrocoy. This is a good option for people who happen to be in this area or heading out to the Paria Peninsula.

The highest point of Mount Roraima is located on the southern edge of the cliff at an altitude of 2,810 meters in Venezuela, and another protrusion at an altitude of 2,772 meters at the junction of the three countries in the north of the plateau is the highest point in Guyana. The name of Mount Roraima came from the native Pemon people. Roroi in the Pemon language means "blue-green", and ma means "great".
